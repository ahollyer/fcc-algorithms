# FCC Algorithms - Aspen Hollyer
### My solutions to the JavaScript Algorithm Challenges at [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com)

###Project Notes

There's so much to learn, but I'm proud of how far I've come! [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) has been a great resource, but I've also found the [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series and the [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com) JS courses to be invaluable.

####Strengths:
* So far, I've coded all of my own solutions rather than looking at tutorials or other people's work.
* These challenges have really helped me learn to break a complex task into a series of logical steps.

####Things to Improve:
* Once I finish, I should look at others' solutions to see if they found more efficient ways to solve these problems. Then, I should refactor my code accordingly.

I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn together!
